# Front-running Attack Implementations
### General Async Python Web3 Infrastructure
Completed for Zachary Stucke's Computer Science BSc dissertation on front-running attacks and their mitigations in blockchain. 
Code is available under a GNU General Public License v3.0, to be used to extend the attack implementations or any other use of the underlying Web3 class wrappers.

A licenced web template was used to build the dashboard (http://3.66.150.226/), this software has been ommitted for licencing reasons.

Given the ommissions, some work will be needed to run the system in its entirety. Main.py has been setup to run as is after installing python and node requirements.
